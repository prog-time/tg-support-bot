# Laravel Coding Standards

## General PHP Standards
- Use PSR-12 coding standards
- Always use strict typing with `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types
- Prefer dependency injection over static methods
- Use Laravel's built-in facades when appropriate

## Laravel-Specific Patterns
- Use Laravel's service layer pattern for business logic
- Keep controllers thin - delegate to services
- Use DTOs for data transfer between layers
- Use Laravel's validation rules in Form Requests
- Follow Laravel naming conventions:
  - Controllers: `{Name}Controller`
  - Services: `{Name}Service`
  - Models: Singular, PascalCase
  - Migrations: `{timestamp}_{description}.php`

## Database & Models
- Use Laravel migrations for schema changes
- Define relationships in models using Laravel's relationship methods
- Use model factories for testing
- Implement proper model events and observers when needed

## Testing
- Write unit tests for services and models
- Use Laravel's testing helpers and assertions
- Mock external services in tests
- Use database transactions for test isolation
